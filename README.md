# 01Space ESP32 module, Hayes Bat Detector frequency display.

This code is for running on the 01Space ESP32 C3-OLED-Pico (an ESP32 varient combined with a mini 0.42" OLED display).              
With it programmed, and connected up to the Haynes Bat Detector circuitry, you can have an accurate frequency monitor to display the currently monitored audio frequency.

 "BUILD YOUR OWN BAT DETECTOR: Who says you can't hear bats? With the Haynes Build Your Own Bat Detector Kit, you can turn the ultrasonic calls of bats into audible sounds.                            
                            
NO SOLDERING REQUIRED: Easy to assemble, with all components and relevant wiring included, you do not require a solder to create your own bat detector. Suitable for children aged 14 and above, the Haynes Build Your Own Bat Detector Kit is the perfect starter project for aspiring engineers and can serve as a wonderful learning tool for those who love electronics and how they work.                            
                            
CREATE YOUR OWN BAT DETECTOR: Once built, you will have your very own handmade high-quality ultrasonic detector perfect for tracing these fascinating flight artists. Housed in a cardboard picture box, the completed device will detect not only the sound of bats but also a host of technical devices that emit ultrasonic sounds. You will be surprised how many inaudible acoustical sources surround us Boost your ears: 20 kHz is not enough"                            
                            
                            
The currently shown frequency signifies the audible ultrasound frequency that can be heard.

The change in wiring for the frequency display. Using an ESP32 and combined OLED. Along with a buck converter for 9v to 5v                 
There's a link at the bottom to see the wiring up close..........
